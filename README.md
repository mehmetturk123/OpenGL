# OpenGL
***This repo based on "https://learnopengl.com/" site.***

**I'm using GLFW and GLAD for external libs. ( pre-compiled binaries for VS 2022 and also dll version)**

Note: Project abondened due to harsh life standards!(Dorm life) Once life becomes a bit more livable, I'll continue to develop this project with passion, don't worry about it :)
